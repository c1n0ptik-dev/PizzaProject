# PizzaProject

## About the Project  
**PizzaProject** is a web application developed using the **Python Flask framework** during my first semester at **Fontys University**. The project was created for fictional pizza cafe owners, **Luigi and Mario**, with the goal of simplifying their operations and providing an easy-to-use system for managing orders, menu items, and customer interactions.

The application allows customers to view the menu, place orders, and track their order status. For cafe owners, it provides the ability to manage inventory, update the menu, and monitor incoming orders.

## Key Features  
- **Menu Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete menu items.  
- **Order Management**: Customers can place orders, and admins can track and update their statuses.  
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for both customers and administrators.  
- **Order Status Tracking**: Real-time updates for customers on the status of their orders.  
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage orders, menu items, and customer details.

## Technologies Used  
- **Python Flask**: The framework used to build the web application.  
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the user interface.  
- **SQLite**: Used for storing data about orders, menu items, and users.  
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic page updates and user interaction.  

## My Contributions  
- Developed the **menu management** system, allowing admins to easily update menu items.  
- Created the **order management** system, allowing both customers to place orders and admins to manage them.  
- Designed the **UI layout** and implemented interactive elements using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- Worked on **backend logic** using Flask, ensuring smooth operation between the frontend and database.  

This project demonstrates my skills in **web development**, **backend programming with Python**, and my ability to build functional applications from scratch.
